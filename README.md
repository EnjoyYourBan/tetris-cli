# Tetris-CLI
<b>Tetris-CLI is a cross-platform(hopefully) command-line tetris game which has color support and many other features to come.</b>


Probably going to require a decent amount of fixes, this project was made while I was in the process of learning not only the library but also C++ in general.

# Compiling

`cmake .`

`cmake --build . && bin/tetris`
