Probably going to require a decent amount of fixes, this project was made while I was in the process of learning not only the library but also C++ in general.

# Compiling (LINUX)
`git clone https://github.com/EnjoyYourBan/tetris-cli.git && cd tetris-cli/build`

`cmake .`

`cmake --build . && bin/tetris`

# CONTROLS
Arrow Keys,

R = rotate

C = hold/swap

## Known Issues
- none?

## Planned
- Options menu
- *more* score
- Better rotations (incl tspin)
